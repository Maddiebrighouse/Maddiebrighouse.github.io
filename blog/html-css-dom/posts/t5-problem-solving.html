    <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
    </h2>

    <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
    <p>
      I couldn't remember how to spell something.
    </p>

    <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
    <p>
      Asked a friend for help or I used the voice Technolgy on my phone to find out how to spell it. I think the word was excited.
    </p>

    <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
    <p>
      Pissed! Becouse it's hard to ask your phone how to spell something when your in public and surrounded by people who can hear you. Even tho I know I shouldn't care about it.
    </p>

    <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
    <p>
      That technology is handy.
    </p>

    <h2>Explain to your non-tech friend Arrays</h2>
    <h3>.map()</h3>
    <p>
      .map() Arrays creates a new array out of whatever function you have added, but it will be appiled to all the elements in the array.
    </p>

    <h3>.filter()</h3>
    <p>
      The .filter() array creates a new array of all the elements that meet the criteria.
    </p>

    <h3> .reduce()</h3>
    <p>
      The reduce() function reduces the values of an array into a single value.
