    <h1>JavaScript Basics 004</h1>

    <h2>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      It's hard to compare because they all do different things. I've found Javascript hard to learn compared with HMTL & CSS. Javascript is a function language it does all the decision making.

    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h2>
    <p>
      Control flow is the order in which we do things like wake up, then get out of bed, then get dressed, but we might have breakfast before we get dressed on some days and this is still controlled flow. Loops are like habit cycles we do, say when we brush our teeth, then we floss and then mouthwash, this is a loop we do every day in the same order.
    </p>

    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
    <p>
      An object constructor creates an object wrapper for the given value.
      Whereas arrays are list-like objects that can be manipulated.
    </p>

    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are part of the building blocks of JavaScript.  Functions are the decision making part that brings forward information stored in variables. They are used to complete actions.
