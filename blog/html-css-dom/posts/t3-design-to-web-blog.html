  <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h3>
  <p>
    In 2016 a study showed that the internet was being viewed on more mobiles and tablets than desktops. Designing for mobile first allows you to include the necessity to create a user-friendly site.

  <p>
    A Wireframe is a sketch of the design of your website, A visual representation of the element on your site. It lets you map out where essential elements go. It allows easier communication with the client, to be able to show them what you are going to do and why.

  <h3>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why?</h3>
  <p>
    I found the rows and columns challenging to get the design I want, as I don't fully understand how to works with the placement of elements.
