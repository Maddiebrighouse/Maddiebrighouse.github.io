  <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
  <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h2>
  <p>
    I tried meditation using the app 'Head space'
  </p>
  <h2>What did you find interesting? </h2>
  <p>
    The micro-habits I found very interesting. How we can slowly change the way, we live with little habits that can be trigger by simple small things.
  </p>

  <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
  <p>
    COUNTERINTUITIVE TIP #6: GIVE YOURSELF LESS TIME, worked well, I was more produtive with less time.</p>

    <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
    <p>
      found other activities like knitting and needlework to be quite calming. But I'm definitely going to look more in the mindfulness.
