    <h2> Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h2>
    <p>
      Provide feedback, Partner to create options and practices. I found that establishing trust, listen (by “looping” and “dipping”) and asking probing and open-ended questions the most useful to get insight and trust of someone.  
    </p>

    <h2> Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h2>
    <p>
      I found that when I was empathic listening that my friend told me more about her issues than she had ever before. I'm totally integrating empathic listening into my everyday life.

    <h2> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h2>
    <p>
      I found it to be very insightful when I came to dealing with my younger brother, the meditation allowed me to not only feel happy within myself, but my brother even said I seemed delighted and intuned he was nicer during the day, well until the internet stopped working and he couldn't game any longer.
