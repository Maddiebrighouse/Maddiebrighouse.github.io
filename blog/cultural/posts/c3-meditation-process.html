    <h1>Meditaion Process</h1>
    <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
    <p>
      I tried to keep reminding myself 'process over product', but I did get very caught up in the product and the end result.
    </p>
    <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
    <p>
      That it is useful for some but not really for me. But I'm finding meditation very useful in my everyday life. I feel less stressed and more focused.
    </p>
    <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
    <p>
      This week I've found that I sleep better after meditating before bed.
    </p>
    <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
    <p>
      Doing things with mindfulness, like when walking.
    </p>
    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
