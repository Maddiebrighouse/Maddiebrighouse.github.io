    <h2> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h2>
    <p>
      When I spend too long without a taking a break, I get frustrated and bad-tempered. I tend to overlook the small stuff and can't see the answers to problems.

    <h2> How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h2>
    <p>
      My younger brother gets on my nerves all the time, his little comments about how something sucks make me so angry, angry that he can't see how lucky he is. But after doing SBNRR, I was able to calm down enough to look at the situation and remember that his anxiety had been bad these past few days. And that he was trying to be cool around people he didn't know while trying to hide his anxiety deep down. So I was able to let the comments wash over me, while I observe my little brother for his signs that things (the world) were getting too much.
