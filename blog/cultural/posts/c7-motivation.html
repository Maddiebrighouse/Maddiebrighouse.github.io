    <h1>Motivation 007</h1>

    <h2>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h2>
    <p>
      Look through the lens of 'Pleasure, Passion & Higher Purpose was very interesting. I had never looked at my life like that. I will be looking into the future in a very differnt.
    </p>

    <h2>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</h2>
    <h2>What are your core values?</h2>
    <h2> What do you stand for?</h2>
    <p>
      My core values are kindness, strength, caring, love, hope and optimism and determination. I believe that life can be mostly luck and chance, but I also think that we are influenced by the people we meet and the relationships we build, the small connections we can make. One can never know what a person has gone through to get where they are in life so I can't judge.
      What I Stand for is equality, the right to freedom of education, food, healthcare. I will continue to fight till there is more equality in the world. I believe it goes hand in hand with world peace. I want to be able to walk home in the dark without having to be alert at every moment with my keys classed in my hand just in case. I have cared for too many friends who have gone through horrific experiences; I stand for them!
    </p>

    <h2> How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h2>
    <p>
      The idea of growing resilience and optimism through meditation and understanding that success and failer are emotions. Through reflection being able to let the emotion flow by thereby increasing Optimus and resilience which I hope I can train my brain to do.
