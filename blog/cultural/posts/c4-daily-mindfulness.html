<h1>Mindfulness 004</h1>
<h2>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h2>
<p>
 The other person told me much more than they meant to because I was so attentive and personable.The conversation quickly turned into a deep and meaningful talk. I found the experience very calming, and I remembered more about the interview.
</p>
<h2>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2>
<p>
  Listening
  Looping: Going back and forth to make sure you understand what the speaker said.
  Dipping: Checking in with ourselves.
  I found Listening the most benefits to me as I often interrupted the speaker to add to the conversation of to direct it.
</p>
<h2>Any other musings?</h2>
