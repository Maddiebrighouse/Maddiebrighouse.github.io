<h1>Self Confidence</h1>

  <h2>What is the relationship between Mindfulness and Self Awareness?</h2>
<p>
They go hand in hand, even to a point where they could be something.
</p>

<h2>What was your experience of it? how did you feel?</h2>
<p>
  I tried both self-awareness practices, and I found the Body Scan more calming whereas I found the ‘Journaling’ difficult due to my writing skills not being able to keep up with my brain. I spent most the time trying to remember how to spell words and the like. But I will keep both practices up in the hope I seeing more results.
</p>

<h2>What did you take away from The Chapter?</h2>
<p>
I want to learn more about being self-aware to the point of being able to control my self-confidence. To be mindful and confident at the same time. To be able to be able to put people at ease around me and to be committable around me. More personal I guess, to be less shy.
